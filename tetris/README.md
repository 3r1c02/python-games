How to play:

Left and right arrow keys to move the object left or right<br>
Bottom arrow key to drop the object faster<br>
'm' and 'n' to rotate the object<br>

If you set 'debug' in the main.py to true, you can press 't' to delete the current object and spawn a new one and press 'r' to reprint the tiles on the screen.
